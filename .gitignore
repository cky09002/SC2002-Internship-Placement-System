# Compiled class files
build/
*.class
out/
# REASON: Compiled bytecode (.class files) can be regenerated from source.
# Build artifacts should not be versioned as they can be recreated.

# IDE specific files
.idea/
*.iml
*.iws
*.ipr
.vscode/
.settings/
.classpath
.project
# REASON: IDE configuration files (.idea, *.iml for IntelliJ, .vscode for VS Code)
# These are personal preferences and machine-specific. Each developer should
# configure their own IDE settings.

# OS specific files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
*.swp
*.swo
*~
# REASON: OS-specific files (.DS_Store for macOS, Thumbs.db for Windows)
# Editor temporary files (*.swp for vim, *~ for backups)
# These have no relevance to the codebase.

# Log files
*.log
# REASON: Log files are generated at runtime and can be large.
# They contain runtime information, not source code.

# Temporary files
*.tmp
*.bak
*.cache
# REASON: Temporary and backup files are not source code and should not be tracked.

# CSV files with personal data (if needed to exclude)
# Uncomment if you don't want to push CSV files
# sample_file/*.csv
# REASON: Sample CSV files are kept commented out to allow tracking of sample data.
# Uncomment if you need to protect sensitive data.

# Java specific
*.jar
*.war
*.ear
# REASON: Packaged Java archives. For plain Java projects without Maven/Gradle,
# these are build artifacts that can be regenerated.

# Maven (if used in future)
target/
pom.xml.tag
pom.xml.releaseBackup
pom.xml.versionsBackup
pom.xml.next
release.properties
# REASON: Future-proofing for potential Maven adoption.
# Maven build artifacts should not be versioned.

# Gradle (if used in future)
.gradle/
gradle-app.setting
!gradle-app.setting3
# REASON: Future-proofing for potential Gradle adoption.
# Gradle build cache and configuration should not be versioned.

# Eclipse
bin/
.settings/
.metadata
# REASON: Eclipse workspace files are IDE-specific and should not be shared.

# NetBeans
nbproject/
nbbuild/
dist/
nbdist/
.nb-gradle/
# REASON: NetBeans project files are IDE-specific and should not be shared.

# Docker-related temp files
.dockerignore.bak
docker-compose.override.yml
.docker/
# REASON: Docker temporary files and override configurations are environment-specific.

# Documentation and assignment files
*.pdf
Assignment.iml
# REASON: PDF files (assignment documents) are large binary files that don't need versioning.
# Assignment.iml is a specific IntelliJ project file that should be excluded.
# NOTE: Keep *.pdf excluded to save repository space.
